# Berlin-Rent-Prices-Web-Scraping-Visualisation-Predictive-Model
I use web scraping to get monthly rent prices of Berlin properties, which I have taken from a popular property website 
called immobilienscout24.de. I then visualise the average rent by postal code on a heat map using Tableau, and also
build a predictive model estimating rent prices based on the attributes of the properties.

The error of the predictive model is 15% of the square metre price or 2.50 Euros, which is a significant improvement over the baseline model
with an error of 29% or 4.50 Euros.

Please see the code for the web scarping in this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/AleKosc/Berlin-Rent-Prices-Web-Scraping-Visualisation-Predictive-Model/blob/master/Berlin_Rent_Scraping.ipynb)
